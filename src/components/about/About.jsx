          I wanted to relate my recent experience dealing with
          scam callers.<br></br>
          Initially, I became angry with numerous calls and 
          decided to block the numbers.<br></br>
          However, it appears that this tactic may have 
          backfired, as the frequency of these fraudulent 
          calls has increased.<br></br>
           It has grown rather puzzling; ignoring  them now 
           appears to produce greater results than blocking. 
           However, <span className='text-[orange] font-bold'>
            No Scam Area App</span> assisted me.</p>
